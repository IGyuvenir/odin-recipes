            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the casserole, mix well and pour in the wine and stock. Bring to boil. Cover and place the casserole in the oven for 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, stir in the mushrooms and leave the casserole on the oven for another 10 minutes. Check if the potatoes are cooked. If not, let them cook a little longer.</li>
